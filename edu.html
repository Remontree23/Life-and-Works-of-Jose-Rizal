                        Jose Rizal enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila in 1877 at the age of 16 to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree. However, he did not graduate from UST due to conflicts with the Dominican friars who managed the institution. Rizal's progressive ideas clashed with the conservative views of the friars, leading to tensions and ultimately prompting him to transfer to the Ateneo Municipal de Manila. </p></div>
